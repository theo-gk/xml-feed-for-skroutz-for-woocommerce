With automatic updates for product additions, deletions, and modifications, this plugin removes the hassle of manually managing feeds, saving you time and effort.

The plugin provides many settings in the admin panel to create the product feed tailored to your needs. In addition, it provides developer-friendly ways to furtherly customize the feed to match specific advanced requirements.
