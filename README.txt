This plugin helps you create an XML feed for Skroutz and BestPrice marketplaces.

== Description ==

XML Feed for Skroutz & BestPrice for WooCommerce is the ultimate tool for WooCommerce store owners looking to maximize their exposure on Greece's leading product marketplaces, Skroutz.gr and BestPrice.gr.

This plugin generates a fully compliant XML product feed, ensuring your store’s products are displayed accurately on these marketplaces.

With automatic updates for product additions, deletions, and modifications, this plugin removes the hassle of manually managing feeds, saving you time and effort.

The plugin provides many settings in the admin panel to create the product feed tailored to your needs. In addition, it provides developer-friendly ways to furtherly customize the feed to match specific advanced requirements.

This plugin will help you to easily pass the strict and challenging Skroutz XML validation process.

= Key Features =

- Fully compliant with Skroutz and BestPrice specifications.
- Full support for product variations with the new format required for Skroutz marketplace. Variations are grouped by size attributes. "Non-size" variations like color etc. appear in the feed as separate products, as per Skroutz requirements.
- Exclude or include products in the feed based on category, and/or tag from the plugin settings. If you need more control, there is a developer-friendly way to include/exclude products programmatically.
- Hide out of stock products from the feed, or products on backorder.
- NEW: Set a global price increase that will modify all product prices in the XML feed.
- NEW: Set a custom "Skroutz price" per product or variation that will be used instead of the regular price in the XML feed.
- Choose between long and short descriptions for product display. If one description is empty, the other is used as fallback.
- Use the new native WooCommerce v9.2+ field for EAN/Barcode, or let this plugin create a new custom field for you.
- Select multiple attributes for manufacturer, color, and size fields.
- Select a Manufacturer from a product attribute, or native "WooCommerce Brands", or even 3rd-party plugins like "Perfect Brands for WooCommerce" (by quadlayers). If no manufacturer info exists on a product, a default value "OEM" will be used to comply with Skroutz requirements.
- Skroutz availability management at global level, and at the product/variation level.
- Select the attributes to include in the product name from the plugin settings.
- Add a fixed shipping rate.
- Developer-friendly ways to customize **ALL** feed data fields, like ID, product title, SKU, availability, images, description, category, price, quantity, weight etc.
- Schedule automatic XML generation using WP Cron or server cron jobs from Plesk/cPanel/SiteGround/GoDaddy or whatever platform you use.
- Email notification in case XML generation fails.
- ZIP format available for huge product feeds.
- WP CLI support for generating the XML file.

= Really Fast & Lightweight =
- Optimized for speed, as it generates the XML way **faster** than any other "Skroutz feed" plugin, and also using far **less memory**, minimizing the stress on the server during the XML creation process.
- Optimized to run on servers with low resources. The minimum PHP memory officially required is 256MB, but it can run with even lower memory for small-sized eshops. The recommended memory for optimal performance is 512MB-1024MB+.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = The automatic XML generation is not working. What am I doing wrong? =
 If you've enabled WP_Cron functionality from the plugin settings, please note that this method can be unreliable for automatic XML generation, especially for larger eshops. The way WordPress works, WP_Cron depends on website traffic to trigger scheduled tasks and may not run consistently on busy or low-traffic sites. It is generally recommended only for stores with a small number of products.
 If your store has thousands of products, we highly recommend setting up a real server cron job via your hosting control panel (such as Plesk, cPanel, or similar platforms). Server cron jobs provide reliable and timely execution regardless of site traffic and are much better suited for handling large XML feed generation tasks.
 Please refer to the [Documentation for Developers](https://doc.clickup.com/2582906/p/h/2eubu-58615/d0b94a4b2c5331e/2eubu-58695) for details on configuring a server cron job.
